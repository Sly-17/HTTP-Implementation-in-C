    <h1>About C++ Notebook</h1>
    <p>
      C++ Notebook is a new software that works like Jupyter Notebook, but it
      runs C++ code instead of Python. This makes it a powerful tool for
      scientific computing and data science, as it allows you to write
      high-performance code that can be easily shared and collaborated on.
    </p>
    <p>
      C++ Notebook is still under development, but it is already a powerful
      tool. It has a wide range of features, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code cells that can be run and edited interactively</li>
      <li>A powerful debugger</li>
      <li>A code editor with syntax highlighting and autocompletion</li>
      <li>A built-in terminal</li>
      <li>Support for multiple programming languages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      C++ Notebook is a great tool for anyone who wants to write
      high-performance C++ code. It is also a great tool for collaboration, as
      it allows you to share your code with others and work on projects
      together.
