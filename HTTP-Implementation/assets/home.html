    <h1>C++ Notebook</h1>
    <p>
      C++ Notebook is a new software that works like Jupyter Notebook, but it
      runs C++ code instead of Python. This makes it a powerful tool for
      scientific computing and data science, as it allows you to write
      high-performance code that can be easily shared and collaborated on.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code cells that can be run and edited interactively</li>
      <li>A powerful debugger</li>
      <li>A code editor with syntax highlighting and autocompletion</li>
      <li>A built-in terminal</li>
      <li>Support for multiple programming languages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you are a C++ developer or a data scientist, then C++ Notebook is a
      great tool for you. It is a powerful and versatile tool that can help you
      write and debug code, collaborate with others, and share your work.
